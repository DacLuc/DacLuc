## ~🎵 Lyrics

## 🎶 Verse 1: Born in the Shell  
🍼 Born in the shell of a README file,  
💻 DacLuc screamed with `commit` style.  
🗣️ `"Hello, world!"` was his first line,  
⚙️ While LucHD debugged the sands of time.

🧠 He learned to code before he could crawl,  
💬 JavaScript babble? He knew it all.  
🐛 Raised by bugs and caffeinated dreams,  
📦 Nightmares built with broken `npm` schemes.

---

## 🔁 🎵 Chorus: *Push It 'Til You Die*  
🧑‍🚀 Push it, pull it, merge and cry,  
💥 Built to ship, **built to die**.  
💔 In this branch where dreams go dry,  
🙏 R.I.P devs — we deploy, then fly.  

---

## 🎶 Verse 2: Hero’s Journey to Dev Hell  
🛠️ He built with hope, he built with flair,  
🔥 Logs on fire, code in the air.  
⚠️ `git status` gave him anxiety,  
🙏 Every sprint? A new variety.

⌨️ Typed his soul in every file,  
📉 Burned out fast, still shipped with style.  
⏳ One last whisper, one last try:  
💀 `git commit -m "Goodbye"`  

---

## 🔁 🎵 Chorus: *Push It 'Til You Die*  
🧑‍🚀 Push it, pull it, merge and cry,  
💥 Built to ship, **built to die**.  
📉 On the CLI where angels sigh,  
🙏 R.I.P devs — we deploy, then fly.  

---

## 🎶 Bridge: The Afterlife Log  
🧾 Logs went silent, VSCode closed,  
🔚 Scripts archived, his keys reposed.  
🕯️ But forks remain, stars never fade,  
🎖️ A legacy in markdown laid.  

👻 LucHD now walks the GitHub skies,  
💡 Refactoring what never dies.  
🔧 Still fixing bugs DacLuc once knew,  
✨ Still yelling, “WHY IS THIS BUILD NEW??”

---

## 🔁 🎵 Final Chorus: *Push It 'Til You Die (Encore)*  
🧑‍🚀 Push it, pull it, test, then cry,  
💣 Built on tears, **built to die**.  
🌌 In `/dev/null` where legends lie,  
🙏 R.I.P coders — we deploy, then fly.  

---

## 🕯️ Outro: P.S. – The Dev’s Last Echo
🧵 We're born to push,  
🧠 Live to debug,  
💀 Die on a Friday deploy, no hug.  

🎸 Now go forth, brave coder...  
⚙️ Clone with courage,  
🌟 Build with honor,  
🙅‍♂️ And `git blame` no one but fate.  

— ___A very tired DacLuc, probably___
